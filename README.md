This is a python implementation of a Rubik's cube, viewed in a 2D isometric plane, and displayed using pygame. It is possible to move every face manually, as you would with a normal cube, or by creating a random scramble. The user can then choose to solve the cube with an implementation of the Old Pochmann method, or with Kociemba's algorithm.
